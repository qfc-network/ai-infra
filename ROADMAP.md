# ai-infra Deep Dive Roadmap

## Context

The repo currently has 51 topics across training, inference, architectures, and open-source infra. The goal is to systematically fill the gaps — topics that are either directly referenced by existing write-ups or are widely used in practice but not yet covered. Each new entry follows the established template: ~2,000–2,500 words, 1–2 equations, one Engineering Tradeoffs table (4–6 rows), both `en.md` and `zh.md`, and an update to the root `README.md` / `README.zh.md` index.

## Completed Phases

### Phase 1 — Foundational Gaps ✓
All six entries complete: Scaling Laws, GQA, RoPE, Orca, LoRA/QLoRA, GRPO.

### Phase 2 — Inference & Training Depth ✓
All four entries complete: Mixed Precision Training, Chunked Prefill, KV Cache Quantization, verl.

### Phase 3 — Alignment & Post-Training ✓
Both entries complete: Constitutional AI, SimPO.

### Phase 4 — New Vendor Sections ✓
All three entries complete: DeepSpeed (Microsoft), Cutlass (NVIDIA), TensorRT-LLM (NVIDIA).

### Phase 5 — Model Family Gaps ✓

| # | Topic | Directory | Status |
|---|-------|-----------|--------|
| 16 | Gemma 2 | `google/gemma2/` | ✓ done |

### Phase 6 — Inference-Time Scaling & DeepSeek Arc ✓ (added April 2026)

| # | Topic | Directory | Status |
|---|-------|-----------|--------|
| 17 | Inference-Time Scaling — Test-Time Compute | `foundational/inference-time-scaling/` | ✓ done |
| 18 | DeepSeek-V2 | `deepseek/v2/` | ✓ done |

## Active Gap Analysis

### Post-training / alignment
- **RLHF at scale — reward model training** — the RLHF entry covers PPO; the reward model training pipeline (data collection, preference labeling, RM architecture, Goodharting mitigations) has no dedicated entry. Candidate for Phase 10.

### Inference systems
- **Continuous batching deep dive** — Orca/vLLM cover the concept; a deeper treatment of scheduling policies (chunked prefill + decode interleaving, priority queues, SLO-aware scheduling) has no dedicated entry.

### Multimodal infra
- **Vision-Language serving** — ViT tokenization, variable-resolution tiling, cross-modal attention, prefill cost of visual tokens; becoming relevant as Llama 4 and Qwen3 both ship native vision.

## Execution Notes

- **Each topic**: `en.md` + `zh.md`, update `README.md` + `README.zh.md` index
- **Format**: ~2,000–2,500 words, 1–2 key equations, 1 tradeoffs table (4–6 rows)
- **Tone**: engineering-first — what are the memory/compute/latency consequences?
- **Cross-references**: link to related entries; do not repeat content already in a standalone entry

## Files to modify per entry
- `{vendor}/{topic}/en.md` (new)
- `{vendor}/{topic}/zh.md` (new)
- `README.md` (index entry)
- `README.zh.md` (index entry)
- `{vendor}/README.md` (if vendor-specific index exists)
